Dextra Challenge

This README will explain some choices made for this challenge architecture.

First, to set up the Espresso Android, we need to add theselines into the project gradle:

androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.2'
androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.2'
androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test:rules:1.0.2'

And then these for lines for Cucumber:
First:
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.jacoco:org.jacoco.core:0.7.9'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'jacoco'

Into dependencies{}:
androidTestImplementation 'info.cukes:cucumber-android:1.2.5@jar'
androidTestImplementation 'info.cukes:cucumber-picocontainer:1.2.4'

Then:
def getTestTags() {
    return project.hasProperty("tags") ? project.getProperties().get("tags") : ""
}

Now, the structure to run BDD with Cucumber is pretty default and common knowledge, as we try to follow good practices.
Under androidTests, we create packages (or directories/folders) such as:
- pages
	- constants (used for writing constants and other variables)
		- java class: 
	- robot (where most of our logic is written)
		- java class: 
- runner
	- actions (almost never changes, it is basically good practices and performance)
		- java class: 
		- java class: 
- steps (another place to write our logic, this will talk directly with our test cases)
	- java class: 

Now we will create our cucumber file as .feature, under Project>project-name>app>src>androidTest>assets>features>name.feature
This is where our test cases will be written.



First clone the git from: ...
To run all tests, go to the Java class called Instrumentation and under @Test, then click the Green Arrow.
